# shellFiddle

Just a pet project that works with a few shell scripts manipulating text and numbers. 
It has a few text files that the scripts are working with. Change the file if necessachry.
NOTE: Don't forget to give rw permissions to the shell scripts. Otherwise the scripts won't execute. For example:
```
chmod 755 ./1.1_randomNumber.sh
```

It should then look like this:
